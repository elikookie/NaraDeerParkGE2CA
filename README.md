Our project is an Artificial Life simulation of the deers in Nara Park with the ability for the player to interact with them by feeding them just like in real life.
The deers wander around the park, avoid obstacles using ray casting and sometimws flock together or graze the grass.

When the player is holding deer cookies also known as shika senbei in Japanese, the deers start following the player and bow to get their food. 
This behaviour is inspired by the real life Nara deers who also bow for their food and that is one of the reasons they are famous.

Thank you and I hope you enjoyed this project.
Some of the assets and animations were made by us (the deer animations and the deer cookie stand model and texture) but others and the audio files were taken from public and free online sources - all credits are put in the same folder as the assets in a .txt file usually named credits.txt
